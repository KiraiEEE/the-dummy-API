# My First Flask REST API!

Yo, what's up everyone! I just made my first Flask REST API in like 2 hours, so please don't expect anything too fancy or complicated from me just yet. I'm still learning, but I wanted to share this with you all because I'm really excited about it!

So, what does my API do? Well, it's a simple API that lets you manage a collection of books. You can add new books, get all the books, get a specific book by name, update a book's information, or delete a book. It's all done using simple HTTP requests and JSON data, so it's really easy to use and understand.

Here's a list of all the endpoints you can use:

 <summary> GET /books: Get a list of all the books </summary>
 <summary> GET /books/<book_name>: Get the details of a specific book by name</summary>
 <summary> POST /books: Add a new book to the collection</summary>
 <summary> PUT /books/<book_name>: Update a book's information</summary>
 <summary> DELETE /books/<book_name>: Delete a book from the collection</summary>
 
**Cool, right? I told you it was simple!**


**Thanks for checking out my API, and I hope you have a great day!**
